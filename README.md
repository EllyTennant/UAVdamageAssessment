This repository contains all of the code to run our tephra fall building damage assessment pipeline as described in the 2024 article published in NHESS: 

Tennant, E., Jenkins, S. F., Miller, V., Robertson, R., Wen, B., Yun, S.-H., and Taisne, B.: Automating tephra fall building damage assessment using deep learning, Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. 2024

Before running the pipeline the trained models can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1553y4oAvg0TEA_gDy45SxLaMdiFxeKiY?usp=sharing. The pipeline runs in MATLAB on an orthomosaic image that needs generating separately. Included within the CODE folder is the pipeline master script and another script to cut an orthomosaic image into patches for use within the pipeline.
